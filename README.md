# MIPSFlappyBird
Flappy Bird-inspired game done in MIPS Assembly in MARS (MIPS Simulator). Completed April 2024.

To set up MARS for this project, the end user will need to connect the bitmap display and the keyboard simulator. For the bitmap display, the user should make sure that the following fields are set as follows: Unit Width = 8, Unit Height = 8, Display Width = 256, Display Height = 256, and Base Address = 0x10040000.
